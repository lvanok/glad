A seasoned professional, also interested in Wellness.  Interested in keeping  myself in top health by eating clean, exercising, and learning new/emerging technology.  I have many interests, some of which are boating and the outdoors.  I try to walk on a regular basis and do yoga at least twice a week.  I am a supportive person and I love helping people feel and look better about themselves.
